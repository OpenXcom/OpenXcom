# Locate SDL_mixer library
# This module defines
# SDLGFX_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
# SDLGFX_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
# SDLGFX_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL/SDL.h
#
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR
# used in building SDL.
#
# Created by Guillaume Chevallereau. This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake 
# module.
