# the commendation will be given out repeatedly.
#   totalKillsWithAWeapon
#   totalMissionsInARegion
#   totalKillsByRace
#   totalKillsByRank
# The following criteria allow more control over the kinds of kills that can be awarded.
# To use, you must define a killCriteria.
# The killCriteria can list any race, rank, weapon, ammo, 
# or one of these statuses: STATUS_DEAD and STATUS_UNCONSCIOUS,
# or one of these factions: FACTION_HOSTILE, FACTION_NEUTRAL, FACTION_PLAYER.
# or one of these battle types: BT_FIREARM, BT_AMMO, BT_MELEE, BT_GRENADE, BT_PROXIMITYGRENADE, BT_MEDIKIT, BT_SCANNER, BT_MINDPROBE, BT_PSIAMP, BT_FLARE, BT_CORPSE
# or one of these damage types: DT_AP, DT_IN, DT_HE, DT_LASER, DT_PLASMA, DT_STUN, DT_MELEE, DT_ACID, DT_SMOKE
# Use the strings from the ruleset to define them (mods can be used too). 
# For example, look at "STR_MEDAL_BOLTS_CROSS_NAME". It is awarded if a soldier
# stuns one hostile commander or stuns one hostile leader.
#   killsWithCriteriaCareer 
#   killsWithCriteriaMission
#   killsWithCriteriaTurn
# It is possible to reduce the amount of awards a commendation gets, but still reaching
# the triple gold star decoration. To do this, repeat the numbres in the criteria vector.
# For example, [5, 10, 20, 20, 20, 20, 40, 40, 40, 40] will have one award for 5, will have a 
# second award for 10 (bronze star), will have a third award for 20 (2 silver stars) and 
# will have a fourth award for 40 (3 gold stars).
