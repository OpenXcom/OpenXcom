# To the poor soul that happens to think that messing with UI is a cool thing to do:
# Run away while you still can. Run and never, ever think of coming back. You won't find
# anything apart from desolation and despair here. Everything you touch will hurt and kill you.
# Also, this file is generated automatically. Go away.
# 
# Still there? Okay, fine, you've asked for it.
# First off, the text here is case-sensitive. Don't ask.
# Second, some fields are required, others are not.
# Third, this file is generated from BattlescapeState source code. You shouldn't mess with
# the things like names or event handlers. Seriously, just don't.
