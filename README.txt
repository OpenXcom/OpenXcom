#################

OpenXcom is an open-source reimplementation of the popular
UFO: Enemy Unknown (X-Com: UFO Defense in USA) videogame by
Microprose, licensed under the GPL and written in C++ / SDL.
See more info at the website: http://openxcom.org

Uses modified code from SDL_gfx (LGPL) with permission from author.

1. Installation
================

OpenXcom requires the original X-Com resources (any version).
If you have the Steam version, you can find the X-Com game
folder in "Steam\steamapps\common\xcom ufo defense\XCOM".

When installing manually, copy the X-Com subfolders (GEODATA,
GEOGRAPH, MAPS, ROUTES, SOUND, TERRAIN, UFOGRAPH, UFOINTRO,
UNITS) to OpenXcom's Data folder:

- <working directory>\data\
- <binary directory>\data\

The resources can be in a different folder as the OpenXcom data.
You can also specify your own path by passing the command-line
argument "-data <data path>" when running OpenXcom.

1.1. Windows
-------------

OpenXcom will also check the following folders:

- C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\My Documents\OpenXcom\data (Windows 2000/XP)
- C:\Users\<user>\Documents\OpenXcom\data (Windows Vista/7)

It's recommended you copy the resources to the "data" subfolder.
The installer will automatically detect a Steam installation
and copy the resources as necessary.

1.2. Mac OS X
--------------

OpenXcom will also check the following folders:

- <application resources>\data
- ~/Library/Application Support/OpenXcom/data

It's recommended you copy the resources to the application's "data"
resource (right click the application > Show Package Contents >
Contents > Resources > data).

1.3. Linux
-----------

OpenXcom requires the following libraries:

- SDL (libsdl1.2):
http://www.libsdl.org
- SDL_mixer (libsdl-mixer1.2):
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
- TiMidity++ (timidity):
http://timidity.sourceforge.net/
- SDL_gfx (libsdl-gfx1.2), version 2.0.22 or later:
http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/content/view/19/14/
- yaml-cpp, version 0.2.6 or later:
http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/

Check your distribution's package manager or the library
website on how to install them.

According to the XDG standard, OpenXcom will also check the
following folders:

- $XDG_DATA_HOME/openxcom/data
- $XDG_DATA_DIRS/openxcom/data

Or if those variables aren't available:

- ~/.local/share/openxcom/data
- /usr/share/openxcom/data
- /usr/local/share/openxcom/data

Choose whichever you prefer.


2. Customization
=================

OpenXcom creates a User folder with all the user screenshots,
savegames and options in one of the following paths:

- <working directory>\user\
- <binary directory>\user\
- C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\My Documents\OpenXcom (Windows 2000/XP)
- C:\Users\<user>\Documents\OpenXcom (Windows Vista/7)
- ~/Library/Application Support/OpenXcom (Mac OS X)
- $XDG_DATA_HOME/openxcom (Linux)
- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openxcom (Linux)

You can also specify your own path by passing the command-line
argument "-user <user path>" when running OpenXcom.

2.1. Options
-------------

OpenXcom stores various game settings in the options.cfg
YAML file stored in the User folder, which can be easily
edited with any text editor. You can also pass command
line arguments in the form "-<option name> <option value>".

WARNING: Editing the options manually with invalid values
can cause incorrect behaviour or game crashes.

2.2. Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------------

F5 - Turns on/off FPS counter in top-left corner.

F12 - Saves BMP screenshot to User folder.

ALT-ENTER - Turns on/off fullscreen mode.

2.3. Custom Music
------------------

If you don't like or have trouble getting the original X-Com
music to work, you can use your own by putting it in
the SOUND subfolder of the Data folder with the same filename
as the original (GMGEO1, GMGEO2, GMSTORY, etc). The formats
supported are MIDI, MP3, OGG and MOD. You might need to delete
the original music (including GM.CAT) for it to work.
