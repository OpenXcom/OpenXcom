<h1>API documentation for libmpg123 and libout123</h1>
<div style="padding:1em;">
	<strong>Note:</strong>
	This API doc is automatically generated from the current development version that you can get via Subversion or as a daily snapshot from <a href="http://mpg123.org/snapshot">http://mpg123.org/snapshot</a>.
	There may be differences (additions) compared to the latest stable release. See
	<a href="http://mpg123.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/NEWS.libmpg123?view=markup">NEWS.libmpg123</a>,
	<a href="http://mpg123.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/NEWS.libout123?view=markup">NEWS.libout123</a>,
	and the overall <a href="http://mpg123.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/NEWS?view=markup">NEWS</a> file on libmpg123 versions and important changes between them.<br />
	Let me emphasize that the policy for libmpg123 and libout123 is to always stay backwards compatible -- only <em>additions</em> are planned (and it's not yet planned to change the plans;-).
