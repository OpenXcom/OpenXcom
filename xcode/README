To successfully build an OpenXcom OSX bundle you will need the relevant Xcode project files provided herewith as well as all the relevant dependencies installed in /usr/local/.

The dependencies you require are following:
- SDL (libsdl1.2)
- SDL_mixer (libsdl-mixer1.2)
- SDL_gfx (libsdl-gfx1.2), version 2.0.22 or later
- SDL_image (libsdl-image1.2)
- yaml-cpp, version 0.5 or later 

If you want to save yourself the trouble - don’t do it manually, use Homebrew package manager - http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ or MacPorts - https://www.macports.org/ instead. 

1. This guide assumes you listened to the previous recommendation and had your dependencies installed with brew terminal command (for Homebrew), like this:
$ brew install yaml-cpp sdl sdl_gfx sdl_image sdl_mixer --with-flac --with-libmikmod --with-libvorbis

or port terminal command (for MacPorts), like this:

$ sudo port install yaml-cpp+universal libsdl+universal libsdl_gfx+universal libsdl_image+universal libsdl_mixer+universal

2. Now, open the OpenXcom.xcodeproj’ file and add the source folder to the project:
‘Right-Click’ on the OpenXcom project icon in the left pane, select ‘Add Files to “OpenXcom”’, traverse the folder tree up one level and select the ‘src’ folder to be added. Just make sure you choose ‘Create groups for any added folders’ option when adding this to your build target.

3. Click on the OpenXcom target in the middle pane and select the ‘Build Phases’ tab. Look down at ‘Copy Bundle Resources’ container and delete all the files irrelevant to our build, namely:
- OpenXcom.2010.vcxproj
- CMakeLists.txt
- Makefile.simple
- OpenXcom.rc
- OpenXcom.2010.sln
- OpenXcom.2010.vcxproj.user
- OpenXcom.2010.vcxproj.filters
- Makefile.gcc-pch

4. Push the ‘Build’ button and cross your fingers ;)

5. Find your newly created bundle in ‘./DerivedData/OpenXcom/Build/Products/Release’ folder and copy it to some place you feel comfortable keeping your games in.

6. Don’t forget to copy all the relevant original game data files you possess into the relevant ‘data’ folder within the bundle, or otherwise the game won’t start. If asked by OSX what to do with the files and folders already present there, select ‘Merge’.

7. Enjoy!
